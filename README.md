# Tizlek (WIP)
[osu](osu.ppy.sh "osu")-like rhythm game on pure SwiftUI

### Design
- Pure `SwiftUI` at any cost. Zero `UIKit` imports
- Full Apple-crossplatform. Playable on `iOS`, `macOS`. (`tvOS` later)
- Only modern APIs, zero legacy support. `iOS 16+`
- Zero dependencies

### Goals
- Formulate some clean and simple architecture for Apple-crossplatform `SwiftUI` rhythm projects
- Collect all the bad hacks in the world

### Why it's so messy?
- I made it
- SwiftUI is young and raw
- APIs and project itself is constantly changing
